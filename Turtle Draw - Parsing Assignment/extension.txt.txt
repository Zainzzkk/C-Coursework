My extension is a simple but useful addition to my project. 
1) Colour selection for the program.  The first option is to select the colour of the line by entering RGB values and confirming if happy with them. 
2) I have made the option of typing in your own instructions or scanning in a file.  When typing in, END in capitals must be entered at end of instructions.  
3) I have made the option of reviewing all the instructions and changing them if required (with confirmation of what is going to be changed)
4) An added bonus is the ability of using SDL to write your name or a word.  This is still quite primative but it does write names (usually a max of 5 letters).  Writing a word or name requires alphabet files from a - z to be present in the same directory as the instructions are in those files.  The function takes the character, adds .ttl and then reads in the file.
