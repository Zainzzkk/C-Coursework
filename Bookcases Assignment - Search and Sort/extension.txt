Hi,

In my extension file, I have plotted the routes taken by the books if verbose flag used.
The first arrow starts from where the book was and it points all the
way round and up/down the route until it points to where the book is.
The functions have been tested.
In addition, the route is also in the colour of the moved book.

Enjoy.
